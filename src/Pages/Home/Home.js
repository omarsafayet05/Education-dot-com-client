              Education.com was launched on the premise that everyone deserves
              access to a world-class education. In 2019, we built the first
              collection of free online school & college courses from the
              worldâ€™s top universities. The world of open education has exploded
              since then, so today our curated lists of online courses are hand
              selected by our staff to show you the very best offerings by
              subject area. We also make sure there is something for everyone:
              whether you want to explore a new topic or advance in your current
              field, we bring the amazing world of academia to you for free.
